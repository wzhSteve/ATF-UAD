# ATF-UAD
This repository supplements our paper "An Adversarial Time-Frequency Reconstruction Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection"

Published in Neural Networks 2023

## Installation
This code needs Python-3.7 and pytorch 1.8.1 or higher.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preprocessing
We have preprocessed all datasets and the link of them is shown as following, meanwhile we offer the checkpoints of all dataset to help you reproduce the results.
```bash

```
After download the zip files, extract them to the corresponding folders.

## Result Reproduction
To run a model on a dataset, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py --model <model> --dataset <dataset> --<process>
```
where `<model>` can be 'ATF_UAD' or other baselines. `<dataset>` can be one of 'SMAP', 'PSM', 'SWaT', 'WADI', 'SMD', 'MSDS', 'MBA', 'UCR' and 'NAB. `<process>` can be 'test' to reproduce the result based on the checkpoints and 'retrain' to retrain the models. For example:
```bash
python3 main.py --model ATF_UAD --dataset NAB --test
```
